## Install Required Packages

1. Install node v11.15.0. It's recommended to install `nvm` to switch between node versions.
2. Install Ruby v2.7.2. It's recommended to install `rvm` to safely switch between ruby versions.
3. Go to project root folder. Run `npm install` to install all required packages for the project.

## Initialize Local Showcase

1. Execute `npm run watch:assets` to build and start watching SCSS and JS files changes.
2. Execute `npm run watch:showcase` to initialize Jekyll locally.
3. Open <http://127.0.0.1:4000/shared-ui/> on your browser to visualize the showcase.

**Did you experience any problem executing showcase?**
Run `gem install bundler jekyll` to install missing [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) bundler, but also make sure you meet all [requirements](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#requirements).

## Workflow.

**Note:** Do not commit directly on `master`, `development` or `gh-pages` branches.

1. Run `git checkout -b branch-name development` to create a new branch from `development` branch. You must give it a descriptive name based on the task you are working on, for example:
	* `new/SUI-124` for new features.
	* `fix/SUI-124` for bugfixing and improvements.
	* `doc/SUI-124` for documentation.
2. Commit and push your changes to your new branch: `git push -u development branch-name`.
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md` file with the correct description of your changes. Include DEV NOTES where applicable.
3. Once you're done with a task, file a Pull Request for your branch against `development` branch. Make sure PR name follows Conventional Commits guidelines.
4. Assign your PR to @iamleigh for code review. **Note:** `CHANGELOG.md` must be updated in order for your changes to be approved.
5. Once the Pull Request has been approved, it will be merged in `development` branch.
6. You can delete your branch locally and make sure it does not longer exist remote.

As soon as you start working with your task, it's a good idea to move it to "In Development" column on the JIRA board and as soon as you submit the Pull Request, move it to "Waiting for Merge" column so everybody knows what's going on with the project.

## Scoping Styles & Scripts

In order to avoid conflicts with other versions of this library, we are using a versioned body class in the format `.sui-x-y-z`. This class is automatically generated by the `body-class` mixin which should wrap all scss in the project.

Any base styles should also include the `.sui-wrap` class. This class is used in place of the `.wrap` class for plugin admin pages to prevent any Shared UI specific styles from bleeding into the wp-admin menubar and sidebar.
